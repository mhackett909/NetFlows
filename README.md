# NetFlows
This project includes a PCAP parser and autoencoder. The parser partitions the packets and extracts statistical features for the autoencoder to learn from. The autoencoder has 16 possible configurations. This project is based on the netml study by Yang et al.

This project focuses on 5G PCAPs. I also have a NetFlows_MODBUS side project.
