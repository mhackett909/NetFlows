# NetFlows
This project includes a PCAP parser and autoencoder. The parser partitions the packets and extracts statistical features for the autoencoder to learn from. This is based on the netml study by Yang et. al.

You may also be interested in my NetFlows_MODBUS side project. I plan on merging the projects eventually.
